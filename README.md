# Expo Camera Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera properties before the camera has fully initialized.  This results in an error similar to `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'cameraRef.current')`.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that utilizes asynchronous operations to ensure the camera is ready before accessing its properties. The solution involves using the `ref` and `useEffect` hook to manage the camera's state and properly handle its initialization within a callback.

This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access camera features before the camera has fully initialized.  This often manifests as undefined values or errors when referencing properties like `cameraRef.current` within the component's lifecycle methods (like `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`, etc.). The problem stems from asynchronous initialization of the camera.
